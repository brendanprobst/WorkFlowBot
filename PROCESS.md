WOBot_Process
Start of Process 1 [See image /processImages/process0]
Before we began working on this, we met and discussed the different story points that we would need to accomplish.
Tasks were divided, though it was agreed that we would offer help if people ran into issues. We agreed to utilized discord for communication, github for version control, and VS code live share to collaborate.

End of Process 1 [see image /processImages/process1]
At the end of the first process, we had a solid skeleton to build off of. We could interact with the user via the terminal and had a config file that would hold the users's workflows.

At the end of process 1, we realized that we would need to do more research about interacting with the windows OS from the terminal. The next week was spent researching to develope a plan for process 2.
Additionally, we agreed to switch the Kan Ban board from github to Notion. We made this decision because all the team members have used notion extensively for agile-planning, and were comfortable with it.

Beginning of Process 2:
We had a meeting to discuss what each member had learned. We developed a plan to implement the core functionality of WOBot (opening batches of programs) and we validated the story points laid out in process 1. We decided that we all the story points were still valid and necessary.
End of Process 2 [see image /processImages/process2]
By the end of process2, WOBot was able to open batches of files, as well as create templates by selecting programs from the file explorer.

Reflecting on process 2, we are happy with the work that got completed. With a little over a week left to work on this, we are now focusing our energy on the user experience. We have an .exe to run the bot, but still need to create documentation on how to use WOBot as well as handle any issues that people might encounter.
